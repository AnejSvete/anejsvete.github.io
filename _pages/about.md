Hey! I'm Anej[^1]. 
I'm an incoming PhD student, starting my PhD journey next year in [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/), where I'm working with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/).

My interests are still all over the place. 
I have on [latent space interpretation](https://github.com/BoevaLab/latte) and [formal language theory](/publication/failure-arcs-backward).
<!-- 
Side projects are always fun! 
If you would like to collaborate (either as a master's student for a course/semester project or as a researcher), don't hesitate to reach out. -->

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a master's degree in data science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) after completing my bachelor's studies in computer science and mathematics in [Univeristy of Ljubljana](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si).

[^1]: I think the easiest way to figure out how to pronounce my name is to imagine saying "an a" in American English. It's not perfect, but close enough. :)
