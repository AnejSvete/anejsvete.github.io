Hey! I'm Anej.[^1] 
I'm a second-year PhD fellow at the [ETH AI Center](ai.ethz.ch), where I'm co-advised by [prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) and [prof. Valentina Boeva](http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/index.html).

My main research interests lie in the intersection of **formal language theory** and modern **language models**, where I am trying to understand what can language models such as transformers and recurrent neural networks do: Which tasks can they provably (not) solve? What aspects of language can they capture? How can they "reason"? 

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a master's degree in data science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) after completing my bachelor's studies in computer science and mathematics at the [Univeristy of Ljubljana](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si).
You can find my full CV [here](/files/Resume.pdf).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, running and hiking. 
My absolutely favorite (somewhat eccentric) hobby is [aquascapeing](https://aquascapinglove.com/learn-aquascaping/what-is-aquascaping/).

[^1]: I think the easiest way to figure out how to pronounce my name is to imagine saying "an a" in American English. It's not perfect, but close enough. :)
