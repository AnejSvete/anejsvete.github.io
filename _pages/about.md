Hey! I'm Anej.[^1] 
I'm a first-year PhD fellow at the [ETH AI Center](ai.ethz.ch), where I'm co-advised by [prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) and [prof. Valentina Boeva](http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/index.html).

My main research interests lie in the intersection of **formal language theory** and modern **language models**, where I'm trying to improve our understanding of the formal properties of architectures such as recurrent neural networks and transformers with weighted models of computation.
For example, I'm working on characterizing what kinds of probability distributions over sentences can modern language models represent and what implications this has on the way we should think about language models.
I'm also interested in representation learning and its interpretability---for example, I also work on methods for disentangling latent factors in learned representations.

<!-- 
My interests are still all over the place. 
Things I have worked on or I'm interested in include:
- [Latent space interpretation](https://github.com/BoevaLab/latte) 
- Identifiability/disentanglement of learned representations
- Variational inference
- [Formal language theory](/publication/failure-arcs-backward)
- Using tools from formal language theory to investigate NLP models -->

<!-- 
Side projects are always fun! 
If you would like to collaborate (either as a master's student for a course/semester project or as a researcher), don't hesitate to reach out. -->

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a master's degree in data science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) after completing my bachelor's studies in computer science and mathematics at the [Univeristy of Ljubljana](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si).
