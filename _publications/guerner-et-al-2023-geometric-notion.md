excerpt: "We propose a formal definition of intrinsic information about a concept (feature) in a subspace of a language model's representation space. We propose a counterfactual approach that avoids the failure mode of spurious correlations by treating components in the subspace and its orthogonal complement independently."

We propose a formal definition of intrinsic information about a concept (feature) in a subspace of a language model's representation space. We propose a counterfactual approach that avoids the failure mode of spurious correlations by treating components in the subspace and its orthogonal complement independently.
