This work investigates the computational expressivity of language models based on recurrent neural networks. We extend the Turing completeness result by Siegelmann and Sontag (1992) to the probabilistic case, showing how a rationally weighted RLM with unbounded computation time can simulate any probabilistic Turing machine (PTM).
